              <p>
              I dropped out of school at the age of 8 because, in my family, we don't follow the traditional education system
              </p>
              <p>
                My coding adventure began when I was just 9 years old, driven by
                curiosity and a desire to create. I first joined Programming
                Hero Batch 7, and while I faced challenges with the 8th
                milestone, it only fueled my determination to learn more.
              </p>
              <p>
                At age 10, I ventured into the world of C and C++ through the
                Phitron course. Though the concepts were challenging for me at
                that time, these experiences taught me valuable lessons about
                persistence and the learning process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The turning point came in June 2024, when I rejoined Programming
                Hero in Batch 10. This time, with more experience and
                determination, I successfully completed the entire course. This
                achievement marks not just the completion of a course, but my
                growth as a young developer.
              </p>
              <p className="font-medium text-gray-900">
                Today, at 12 years old, I continue to build and learn, excited
                about the endless possibilities in web development and the MERN
                stack.
